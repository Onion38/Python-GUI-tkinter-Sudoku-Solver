# Sudoku-Solver-tkinter
Sudoku Solver Visualizer GUI made with python. The algorithim uses backtracking which you can visualize using this GUI! 


#### The GUI has 3 buttons: Solve, Visual, and Quit. 

Solve: The solve button converts the inputted sudoku into a array, and solves the array THEN displays the solved array. This makes the solve button much faster in comparison to the visual button. 

Visual: The visual button converts the inputted sudoku into a array, however in each step of the backtracking algorithim (Lots of steps) the GUI updates. The Visual button looks really cool as you get to visualize the backtracking algorithim, however, is much slower since you have to update the GUI at each step in the algorithim.

Quit: Exits the application
